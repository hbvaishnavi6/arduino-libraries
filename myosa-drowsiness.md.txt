##Overview:
The Sensor-Integrated Real-Time Anti-Drowsiness Safety System for Drivers, developed using the MYOSA platform, aims to enhance vehicular safety by continuously monitoring driver alertness through integrated sensing technologies. The system employs an eye-blink detection sensor to analyse eyelid closure duration and blink frequency, supported by motion-based sensors to assess driver behaviour.
The proposed system architecture offers an efficient, low-cost, and reliable solution for real-time driver monitoring, making it well suited for implementation in intelligent transportation and advanced driver assistance systems.
### What the Project Does
This project presents a real-time driver safety system that monitors the driver’s alertness and surrounding conditions using multiple sensors integrated with the MYOSA platform. The system detects driver drowsiness through eye-blink monitoring and identifies hazardous situations such as gas leakage or abnormal motion. When unsafe conditions are detected, the system provides immediate voice-based alerts through a DFPlayer Mini module and speaker, ensuring effective and intuitive driver warnings.
### How It Works
The system is built around the MYOSA platform with an ESP32 microcontroller that interfaces with various sensors. An eye-blink detection sensor mounted on the driver’s spectacles monitors eyelid movement to assess alertness levels. Motion and orientation data are obtained from the MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope, while the MQ2 sensor detects harmful gases. Environmental parameters such as temperature, pressure, and altitude are measured using the BMP180 sensor.
All sensor data are continuously acquired and processed in real time by the microcontroller using predefined threshold-based decision algorithms. When prolonged eye closure, excessive gas concentration, or abnormal motion is detected, the controller triggers the DFPlayer Mini module to play pre-recorded audio warnings (such as “Drowsiness detected” or “Alert! Gas detected”) through a connected speaker. Simultaneously, sensor readings and alert messages are displayed on an OLED screen, providing both audio and visual feedback to the driver.
### Who It Is For
The system is intended for automotive drivers operating under extended driving durations, nocturnal conditions, or commercial transport environments, where fatigue-induced impairment is prevalent. It is additionally applicable to fleet management and intelligent transportation systems, enabling enhanced driver safety through continuous physiological monitoring and real-time voice-based alert mechanisms.

**Key features:**
* Real-time monitoring of driver alertness using eye-blink and motion sensors
* Embedded sensor fusion implemented on the MYOSA platform
* Threshold-based drowsiness detection algorithm for fast response
* Speaker-based voice alert system for immediate driver warning
* Low-latency real-time signal acquisition and processing
* Compact, low-cost, and energy-efficient embedded design
* Scalable architecture suitable for intelligent transportation systems
 ## Usage Instructions:
* Ensure that the MYOSA platform is properly powered using a stable power supply.
* The eye-blink detection sensor is mounted on the driver’s spectacles (specks) and aligned with the eye level to ensure accurate blink detection.
* Switch ON the system and allow it to initialize and calibrate the sensors.
* During vehicle operation, the system continuously monitors the driver’s eye-blink patterns and motion data in real time.
* If drowsiness is detected, the system automatically activates the speaker to deliver a voice alert warning.
* The driver should respond to the alert by taking appropriate corrective action, such as resting or stopping the vehicle safely.
* Power OFF the system after vehicle operation is completed.
